          Produced by Dr. Jeremiah Lockwood, Golden Ages is a window into a remarkable music scene in today's Brooklyn that is bubbling with life, hidden away from view of most music lovers. It is located in communities in Williamsburg and Borough Park, and its key players are young Chassidic singers. In the ultra-Orthodox community, older forms of Jewish music have largely been displaced by pop-music that sounds a lot like what you would hear on the mainstream radio, but with pious lyrics in Yiddish or prayer book Hebrew. A small but vibrant group of young singers have taken up the style of pre-World War Two cantorial music as their art form of choice, performing tracks recorded a century ago. This album documents the raw and vital sounds of communication across the divide of time.

        Jeremiah Lockwood is a musician, scholar, curator and author.
        He is the founder of The Sway Machinery, a project that seeks
        inspiration from diverse realms of experience related to the
        cultural geography of New York City. His forthcoming book,
        <em
          >Golden Ages: Chassidic singers and cantorial revival in the
          digital era</em
        >, is a study of young singers in the Brooklyn Chassidic
        community who study early 20th century cantorial records as
        the basis for new musical practices and approaches to prayer
        leading.

        The son of composer Larry Lockwood, Jeremiah’s music career
        began with over a decade of apprenticeship to the legendary
        Piedmont Blues musician Carolina Slim, playing in the subways
        of New York City. He also trained under his grandfather Cantor
        Jacob Konigsberg and performed in his choir. His band The Sway
        Machinery has played around the world, including stints at
        legendary music festivals like Montreal Jazz, Roskilde, and
        perhaps most notably, Festival au Desert in Timbuktu, Mali.

        musician Jewlia Eisenberg (of blessed memory), released their
        debut album in 2018 to critical acclaim.
