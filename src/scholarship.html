        Jeremiah Lockwood is a scholar and musician, working in the fields of
        Jewish studies, performance studies and ethnomusicology. His work
        embraces archival and ethnographic research methods to explore
        19<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th</sup>and 21<sup>st</sup>century Jewish
        liturgical music as a locus for understanding lived experience in
        contexts of political and social change. Jeremiah's career as scholar
        and musician engages with issues arising from peering into the archive
        and imagining the power of “lost” forms of expression to articulate
        keenly felt needs in the present. He successfully defended his
        dissertation in the Stanford University Graduate School of Education
        Concentration in Education and Jewish Studies in 2021, and is currently
        a 2022-23 Fellow at the Yale Institute of Sacred Music.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the 2021-22 academic year, Jeremiah was a Research Fellow at the UCLA
        Milken Center for Jewish American life. As part of this fellowship, he
        wrote a 30-part blog series offering snapshots of his archival and
        ethnographic research.

        Jeremiah is the Lead Researcher for the Cantorial and Synagogue Music
        Archive (CSMA), an ongoing project of the Cantors Assembly Foundation.
        In this role, he works with elder cantors to preserve, digitize and
        disseminate their personal collections of unique 19<sup>th</sup>and
        20<sup>th</sup>century cantorial musical scores. The archive that is
        being built is currently available online even as it continues to grow.

        Jeremiah was the 2019-20 recipient of the YIVO Kremen Memorial
        Fellowship in East European Arts, Music and Theater, the 2020 AJS
        Women's Caucus innovative scholarship award and the 2021 Salo Baron New
        Voices in Jewish Studies Award. His writing has been published in

        <cite>Studies in American Jewish Literature</cite>,

        Jeremiah’s thesis and current book project,
        <cite>
          Golden Ages: Chassidic singers and cantorial revival in the digital
          era</cite
        >, argues that a cadre of young Chassidic singers who have embraced a
        style of early 20<sup>th</sup>century recorded sacred music illustrates
        the contested nature of prayer practices in the post-World War Two
        Jewish American community. The dissertation suggests that contemporary
        Chassidic cantors are not only reviving a style of music but are also
        engaged in a revival of a form of comportment in prayer that foregrounds
        the role of aesthetics in sacred experience. Jeremiah’s dissertation has
        already generated a new archival project that is currently in
        development. Jeremiah is in the initial stage of researching and writing
        a cultural history of Jewish sacred records and recording artists of the
        early 20<sup>th</sup>century, accessing Yiddish primary documents from
        newspaper and archival holdings. His findings suggest that “golden age”
        recorded cantorial music offered power to artists on the perceived
        fringes of religious social norms to wield aesthetic and spiritual
        authority in the context of ritual performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jeremiah's first book is currently in peer review at UC Press. An album
        of music that he produced featuring cantors who participated in his
        research was recently released in collaboration with the Krakow Jewish
        Culture Festival.

      <h2>Research Projects</h2>
      <h3>Golden Ages</h3>
      <p>
        <cite>Golden Ages</cite> relates the engaging stories of a group of
        non-conformist musicians in the New York Chassidic community.
        <cite>Cantorial revivalists</cite> are singers who have immersed
        themselves in the archive of early 20<sup>th</sup>
        century commercial Jewish liturgical records, approaching them as a
        source to build performance identities and musical style. The work of
        cantorial revivalists is a product of the digital era, shaped both by
        access to internet-based archival sources and social media platforms for
        self-promotion. More frequently heard online, in private parties and in
        concert venues than in synagogues, the work of cantorial revival pushes
        at normative associations with Jewish prayer, blurring the line between
        ritual and art.
      </p>
      <p>
        I suggest that contemporary Chassidic cantors are not only reviving a
        style of music but are also engaged in a revival of a form of
        comportment in prayer that foregrounds the role of cantor as arbiter of
        sacred experience. For cantorial revivalists to achieve their musical
        goals they must interpolate audiences into an embodied emotional
        response to the musical cues of the prayer leader. Producing this kind
        of sacred music community, centered on the experience of listening to
        the archive, is a utopian aspiration that has not been realized by the
        revivalists, and perhaps cannot be achieved in the cultural climate of
        the American synagogue. This has not dissuaded singers from investing
        time and resources into self-cultivation of a musical practice with no
        clear home in the current moment.

        Drawing on discourses of sound studies and the study of lived religion
        to historicize listening and contextualize ritual in social experience,
        <cite>Golden Ages</cite> delves into the subculture of cantorial
        revivalists to tell a story about the role of the archive in creative
        endeavors. This story is given shape by the changes in meaning that have
        accrued to Jewish worship music over the course of the 20<sup>th</sup>
        century. In part because of its absence from the contemporary synagogue,
        gramophone era Jewish sacred music has taken on a special significance
        as an object of aesthetic desire and fascination among a cohort of
        artists and cognoscenti. Ironically, in a communal context preoccupied
        with continuity, drawing on sounds of the past pushes artists to the
        sonic margins of Jewish American life, Orthodox or otherwise. In this
        book, I explore how revivalists have appropriated gramophone era
        cantorial music to serve as both a form of artistry and a ritual
        practice that runs against the grain of the norms of American Jewish
        religious life.
      </p>
      <p>
        For performers such as Yanky Lemmer and Yoel Kohn, two of the singers I
        write about, the archive of old Jewish records provides the substance of
        an art practice that is both a means of aesthetic self-cultivation, and
        a form of countercultural non-conformity. These artists straddle
        worlds—Chassidic and secular, art communities and prayer communities—in
        their attempts to find a home for their work. Cantorial revival pushes
        at the limits of self-expression in the ultra-Orthodoxy community on the
        one hand, and the musical norms of the American synagogue on the other.
        Mastery of the sounds of old records does not lead revivalists in the
        direction of a structured career path or a communally stable identity.
        Instead of finding a home in the synagogue, the expected site of
        cantorial performance, revivalists harness the norms of musical
        performance in secular venues to make room for their concept of ritual
        music aesthetics. Cantorial revival gives voice to a critique of the
        norms of American Jewish ritual life, seeking to revive both a style of
        music and a form of sacred listening community that are defined as much
        by aesthetics as by religious orthodoxies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cantorial revivalists do not have an established home in any
        contemporary Jewish institutions where they can pursue their sacred
        music concept. Classic styles of cantorial music are not part of ritual
        practice in the Chassidic community, nor in most Modern Orthodox
        synagogues where the most successful Chassidic cantors are able to find
        employment. After attaining fluency in the sounds of early 20<sup
          >th</sup
        >
        century recording star cantors, Chassidic cantorial revivalists must
        learn other forms of Jewish liturgical music in order to hold
        employment. Instead of a linear narrative arc, the episodic quality of
        cantorial revivalist education involves a series of displacements of
        knowledge: Chassidic singers intentionally displace the ritual music of
        their birth community with a vocabulary derived from the archive of
        cantorial records, but then in the context of employment they must
        embrace localized prayer music practices instead of performing in their
        “target” area of expertise as interpreters of music learned from old
        records. American synagogues, including Orthodox institutions, have
        rejected the cantorial presentational style of prayer leading in favor
        of a participatory folk-pop liturgy that employs a framework of group
        singing of metered melodies. The classic cantorial style, as understood
        by revivalists, is an aestheticized version of Jewish prayer leading in
        which cantors function both as ritual leaders and as artists. Given its
        formal qualities as presentational music, stressing the division between
        performer and audience, cantorial revivalists frequently present their
        work in secular music making venues, such as concert halls or internet
        videos. “Out of context” presentations of sacred music allow cantorial
        revivalists to harness the associations of music venues with
        presentational performance to frame ritual music as a listening genre
        and for music audiences to be drafted into a sacred listening
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The research for <cite>Golden Ages</cite> also produced an album of
        music by some of the artists chronicled in the book. The album is
        scheduled to be released in the Spring of 2022, in coordination with the
        Krakow Jewish Culture Festival, the largest Jewish music festival in the
        world.

      <h3>Melody Like a Confession</h3>
      <p>
        My proposed research project, <cite>Melody Like a Confession</cite>,
        will focus on the generation of transnational artists who created the
        archive of “golden age” cantorial records, exploring the ways in which
        media served as a force of cultural transformation across diasporic
        locations. I have already begun research on this project as a research
        fellow at YIVO in 2019 and have since sharpened my research agenda,
        focusing on the cultural history of contentious discourse surrounding
        cantorial performance, the construction of Jewish vocal identity and the
        role of individuals with non-conforming identities as ritual leaders. I
        have already presented some of my initial findings in talks at scholarly
        meetings and public forums.
      </p>
      <p>
        The classic period of cantorial recording (1901-c.1950) was
        characterized by intense controversy, with critics framing records as a
        corruption of tradition. The anti-gramophone polemics of Cantor Pinchas
        Minkovsky (1859-1924) of Odessa, perhaps the best-known cantor of his
        day, were a touchstone for this debate. An influential book he published
        in 1910 revels in extravagant detail of the wickedness of cantorial
        records; Minkovsky imagines a carnival located in the exotic American
        locale of Texas in which automaton cantors sing in a hall of wax figures
        in an atmosphere of licentiousness and excess. Minkovsky was a leading
        practitioner in a style of cantorial music that drew on the aesthetics
        of European Christian choral music as means towards achieving aesthetic
        cultivation and social mobility for Eastern European Jews. The chorale
        style of cantors in elite synagogues in Europe had a diminished audience
        among immigrant Jews in the United States and was succeeded by a style
        of cantorial performance that was imagined as offering a representation
        of older, folkloric forms of prayer leading. The “authentic” sound of
        recordings star cantors in America was framed in opposition to the older
        sound of elite cantors in “old world” Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast to their critics who castigated their morals, recording
        cantors invoked the spiritual elevation and ethnic solidarity their
        records provided, extolling the virtues of their art as preserving the
        “the soul of the people.” Thousands of records were made by cantors and
        consumed by a robust record buying public for whom cantorial
        connoisseurship was an important part of public conversations about
        music and aesthetics. Cantorial records, and the print media journalism
        and advertising that supported their distribution, provided the
        listening public with what Erving Goffman called “frames” for
        conceptualizing the terms of Jewish sonic life. Recorded media allowed
        consumers to integrate the experience of prayer and the intimacy of
        synagogue practice with a public identity as knowledgeable experts in a
        domain of aesthetics and popular culture. In an echo of Walter
        Benjamin’s discussion of the utopian potentials of mass mediated art
        forms to liberate aesthetics from the monopolization of the elite,
        cantors articulated a vision for their work as part of a proletariat
        identity and valorized their artistry as preservationist of a culturally
        intimate folk experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cantorial scene in America was characterized by an exuberant
        heterogeneity, that was facilitated by the embrace of new technologies,
        such as radio, Yiddish theater and recordings. Echoing the life ways of
        their American Jewish listening public, some star cantors were notorious
        for their non-adherence to normative religious observance and for their
        involvement in secular pop-culture, as stars of theater, opera, or
        vaudeville. In this same period, women performers of cantorial music
        made important contributions to Jewish recorded music, pushing at the
        limit of gender segregation in sacred music. Although traditional
        interpretation of religious law rejects the participation of the female
        voice in Jewish ritual, women performers of sacred music were able to
        find an outlet as cantors on radio, record and stage, forms of
        participation in Jewish ritual culture that were facilitated by
        technological media innovations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cantorial records resounded in the life of the immigrant community as
        both commercial commodity and a form of imagined ethnography. I seek
        clues in the history of these popular media objects to parse a moment in
        the history of American Jews as a newly emerging cultural category.
        Rather than simply regressing listeners into identities as consumers, as
        Theodor Adorno suggests in his writings on phonograph culture, cantorial
        records offered Jewish listeners a set of intelligible signs, markers of
        cultural intimacy rooted in a shared ritual culture. I look to the work
        of Paul Gilroy for a preliminary framework in analyzing the way music
        functioned across diasporic community to articulate structures of
        feeling and transcribe political experience, especially the traumas of
        dislocation and violence in the context of migration and shifts in
        public identity. Through detailed attention to the discussion of sacred
        music in the Yiddish press, I hope to illuminate the way public
        conversations about sacred music reflect private devotional experiences
        and changing conceptions of how listening practices shaped religious
        sentiments and conceptions of ethnicity.
      </p>
      <p>
        My research is in dialogue with scholarly voices in the fields of
        performance studies and sound studies and will contribute to the history
        of lived religion in America by attending to music, media and listening
        practices as sites of religious experience. My project addresses a
        lacuna in the history of American Jewish lived religion. Beyond its
        potential scholarly impact, my research has an activist orientation
        towards reviving listening as a sacred experience in Jewish ritual
        contexts and towards broadening conceptions of who can speak on behalf
        of ritually conceived communities. I seek in the archive of old Jewish
        records a sound that will help narrativize Jewish political, social and
        sacred experience through the genre of recorded cantorial music, a
        forgotten moment in American Jewish popular culture. I am especially
        intrigued by and attracted to the paradox of the virtuoso artist as
        ritual leader, a figure that has largely become absent from Jewish
        liturgical contexts in which participatory frames of ritual music have
        become the norm. I am interested in illuminating the archival traces of
        the cantor as arbiter of historical memory in part because I see this
        role as missing in the contemporary American synagogue. I am pursuing
        this disappeared history of theatrical performance of sacred experience
        because I believe that performance is an aspect of synagogue ritual that
        is in need of greater visibility. I am interested in exploring the
        possibility that the cantorial archive can address current emotional and
        political needs through approaches to public ritual performance that
        were cultivated in the past.

      <h3>Music, memory, identity</h3>
      <p>
        An initial stage research project seeking to reconstruct the listening
        cultures of the gramophone era and its sustained resonance in the lives
        of present day musicians, listeners, and identity communities. This
        project draws inspiration from Walter Benjamin’s conception of the
        utopian potentials of mass mediated art forms. Early “Ethnic” records
        were a commercial art form, made to appeal to a narrowly defined
        audience and capture a share of the record buying public. Popular
        records that are calculated to hail members of a specific identity group
        inevitably shape the way identity is defined by members of the group.
        And yet beyond their role in interpolating listeners into identities as
        consumers along reductive lines of ethnic stereotype, mass mediated art
        forms have been utilized by artists and the communities they serve to
        preserve vital sonic artefacts as well as to create modern iterations of
        intimate forms of culture. The resulting recorded musics at times bear a
        power that cannot be reduced to their role as commodity fetish. I look
        to the work of Paul Gilroy for a preliminary framework to analyze the
        way music functions within communities to articulate structures of
        feeling and transcribe political experience, especially the traumas of
        dislocation and violence. I am interested in exploring how records,
        which in the view of Adorno reduce listeners to a consumer identity, can
        at the same time function as a form of solidarity, mutual aid and
        cultural pedagogy that offer listeners strategies for how to engage with
        new forms of social experience.
      </p>
      <h3>Live davening</h3>
      <p>
        An initial stage research project devoted to collecting and interpreting
        “live davening” bootleg field recordings of cantorial prayer leading
        surreptitiously recorded in synagogues by die-hard fans of cantorial
        music. Field recordings by cantorial aficionados seem to have been made
        since the first portable tape recorders became available and continue,
        to a limited extent, until the present day. Through the efforts of
        mostly anonymous collectors, we are privileged today to be able to hear
        the prayer leading of some of the great names of the cantorial
        tradition, including Pierre Pinchik, Moshe Koussevitsky, Samuel Vigoda,
        Leibele Waldman, and scores of other less well-known but highly
        accomplished artists.
      </p>
      <p>
        What has come to be known as the “golden age” period of Ashkenazi
        cantorial music flourished in Eastern Europe and the Americas in the
        late 19<sup>th</sup> to mid 20<sup>th</sup> centuries and is continued
        today in the work of a handful of elder cantors and passionate
        revivalists. Cantorial music as a popular art form reached its apex
        through commercial recordings made in Europe and New York. While our
        knowledge of cantorial performance in the “golden age” is mediated
        through the archive of old Jewish commercial records, it is understood
        that the live experience of cantorial prayer leading was substantially
        different from what was heard on records. Records offered a theatrical,
        aestheticized version of prayer that by necessity of recording studio
        conventions and technical limitations lacked the durational qualities of
        actual prayer in the synagogue and the noisy friction of cantorial
        soloist interaction with the congregational bodies at prayer.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to first-hand accounts in Yiddish literature and press,
        cantorial prayer leading performances were breathtaking displays of
        technical and emotional prowess that would leave congregations in tears.
        In one representative description we read:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “Cantor Samuel Vigoda ascended the platform in the middle of the
          shul…It wasn’t long before the group of people were cradled in prayer
          and were transformed from indifferent listeners to devoted daveners
          (people at prayer). The commonplace feeling disappeared from every
          Jewish face and the people were as if wrapped in a talis of
          holiness…Gathered together were frum (Yiddish, traditionally observant
          Jews) and secular; young and old; women and men bearing deep emotion
          on their faces and in their longing countenances shone the spirit of
          their grandfathers and grandmothers, from long disappeared
          generations, who still live in their gazing in the old sacred place.”
          (Pinchos Jassinowsky,
          <cite>“In der velt fun khazones un idisher negina,”</cite>
          <cite>Der morgn zhurnal</cite>, January 23, 1948)
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Deep lovers of sacred music were willing to transgress Jewish ritual
        prohibitions on using electronics on the Sabbath and holidays to
        document the live experience of cantorial prayer performance. A lore has
        sprung up around the collectors, including stories about small fortunes
        spent on spy recording devices that could be hidden in pockets and
        prayer books that had the middle of the pages cut out to hold tape
        decks. These recordings circulated among fans in an underground network
        of reel to reel tapes and dubbed cassettes for decades. Today some of
        these historic recordings are available online, uploaded to YouTube and
        other file hosting sites. “Live davening” recordings offer an invaluable
        line of connection to the fiery spirit of Jewish sacred music that
        cannot be contained on the side of a 78rpm record. They serve as a time
        machine, transporting us into a rarified experience of listening as a
        Jewish devotional practice. Furthermore, these bootlegs are an important
        resource for young cantorial revivalists who are seeking to learn how to
        apply the stylistic approach of cantors they know from commercial
        recordings to the “live” experience of synagogue prayer leading.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Live davenning” recordings are a transgressive document of a sacred
        art. They push at the boundaries of the permissible in order to
        celebrate and preserve the sacred. It is my hope that collecting and
        presenting sacred field recordings will shed more light on this corner
        of the world of Jewish expressive culture.
