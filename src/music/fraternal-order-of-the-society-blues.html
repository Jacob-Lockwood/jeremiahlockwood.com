<p><em>&quot;Soulful, tuneful songs that the people can understand.&quot;</em> That's how
<strong>Carolina Slim</strong> described his Blues. Known and loved throughout New
York City for his performances in the subway system as part of the MTA
Music Under New York program, Elijah Staley was one of the last of the
great Piedmont Blues artists. Born in 1926 in Denmark, South Carolina,
Staley was as young as one could be and still have been born into the
Blues: a family of Black farmers, intergenerational music making, the
Church, and a phonograph blasting the music of Buddy Moss and Blind Boy
Fuller. Staley's life journey took him around the world, first as a
Sergeant in the Korean War and later landing in New York City where he
raised his family and forged his music career. After working for decades
as a session drummer in R&amp;B dance bands, Staley reinvented himself in
his later years, reviving his boyhood nickname Carolina Slim and
focusing on the rural guitar music he raised up on.</p>
<p><em>Electric Acoustic Piedmont Society Blues.</em> These were the words
emblazoned on the municipally issued banner Carolina Slim proudly flew
every time he played in the subway. The words conjure the image of a
brave synthesis, standing on the line between the acoustic Piedmont
sounds of the past and the Electric sounds of urban life**.** For us,
his young protégés, the Society Blues was our community, a secret
society of acolytes devoted to the wisdom of our teacher. For in
addition to being a masterful musician, Carolina Slim was a great bearer
of wisdom that he distributed generously during drives across the
expanse of Queens, on subway platforms and on epic late night phone
conversations.</p>
<p>When Carolina Slim left this mortal coil on February 16, 2014, we
decided to keep his music going. <strong>The Fraternal Order of the Society
Blues</strong> debuted on WKCR radio in New York City a few days after the
funeral. A trio of three of his most prominent students, The Fraternal
Order of the Society Blues extends the music of Carolina Slim into the
future.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremiah Lockwood</strong> (guitar and voice) began to play with Carolina
Slim at the tender age of 14. The music of his band The Sway Machinery
has been heard in Festivals around the world. Jeremiah continues the
education he began with Carolina Slim at Stanford University, where he
recently completed his PhD in Education and Ethnomusicology. <strong>Ernesto
&quot;Lover Cat&quot; Gomez</strong> (harmonica and voice) was just in his 20s when he
began to accompany Carolina Slim. Ernesto's band Brotherhood of the Jug
is a mainstay of the Brooklyn folk scene. The elder statesmen in the
trio, <strong>Ricky &quot;Dirty Red&quot; Gordon</strong> (washboard and voice), has had a long
and storied career as a performer with Wynton Marsalis and as a composer
and actor collaborating with iconic filmmaker Spike Lee. Once on a gig
underground in a NYC subway station with Carolina Slim, Ricky brought a
huge drum set. Afterwards Mr. Slim said, <em>Ricky you need to</em> <em>lighten
your load</em> (of the drum set) and from that day on he began playing the
washboard.</p>
