        <h2>Solo</h2>
        <p>
          Jeremiah Lockwood has made several solo albums over the years that
          showcase his fingerpicking guitar style, his connection to historic
          genres of blues and Jewish music, and collaborations with important
          artists.

          Jeremiah has developed a voice working as a liturgist and prayer
          leader, leading High Holiday services for the past decade in
          collaboration with Rabbi Dan Ain, first in Brooklyn as part of the
          Because Jewish Community, and for the past two years at Congregation
          Beth Sholom in San Francisco. Since 2019, members of The Sway
          Machinery have continued to perform Jeremiah's music as part of the
          Because Jewish community's High Holidays offerings, with Yula Be'eri
          serving as vocal soloist.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the coronavirus epidemic of 2020, the High Holiday Services
          were offered as a video recording.

        <p>
          For the past three years, Jeremiah has developed a performing arts
          program at Congregation Beth Sholom, curating Listen, a monthly
          concert series. Where is the boundary between the pleasure and emotion
          inspired by music and the joy and spiritual engagement that we
          encounter in prayer? Is listening a spiritual experience? Curated by
          musician and scholar Jeremiah Lockwood, Listen explores these
          questions in the context of a Friday evening service. Jeremiah curates
          offerings from world-renowned musicians working in diverse genres to
          present profound and soulful musical experiences. Listen offers an
          opportunity to engage in deep listening, hear virtuosic performances,
          and learn about sacred music traditions, broadly construed to embrace
          the breadth of musical experiences that engage the spirit - both
          Jewish traditions and those of the people Jews have shared homelands
          with today and across history.

          This record represents the first ever documentation of Jeremiah's
          performance as a solo Blues guitarist and vocalist. LOCKWOOD
          represents a loving and visceral presentation of the revered country
          blues tradition Lockwood learned from his longtime teacher and
          collaborator, the late great Piedmont Blues legend Carolina Slim.
          Lockwood and Carolina Slim performed together on the streets and in
          the subways of New York City for close to two decades.

        <p>
          Kol Nidre contains nothing but enigmas---it is a fairly dry legalistic
          text that has come to be looked at as soul drenched poetry, ringing
          tears from the eyes of the people as they contemplate their mortality.
          The famous Kol Nidre melody is considered one of the oldest in the
          cantorial music canon, dating to the Middle Ages, and yet it's melody
          plainly bears the mark of 'modern' European classical music influence,
          attesting to the endless changes that Jewish sacred music is
          constantly undergoing. On this record I try to take all of these
          paradoxes into account, drawing from the arcane and the earthy, the
          folkloric and the modernist, to make something that holds true to the
          beautiful shape-shifting of the cantorial music tradition. Features
          Shoko Nagai on organs and John Bollinger on drums.

          Brooklyn musician Jeremiah Lockwood, front man for The Sway Machinery,
          collaborated with diverse partners from a wide variety of musical
          fields and genres to create 10 original nigunim, or songs (mostly)
          without words -- meditative and incantatory melodies to raise the
          spirits, transform the mundane into the holy and elevate the soul
          toward the divine. Crossing continents and genres, this imaginative
          collection of recordings is the product of Lockwood's yearlong
          appointment as artist in residence at The Forward.
