            The musical story of Jeremiah Lockwood is almost hard to believe. His early musical development was guided by his grandfather, a Jewish cantor, and Carolina Slim, a well-known blues guitarist. All those influences crystallize into something unified.

          <q>
            Jeremiah Lockwood &mldr; grew up with two disparate musical mentors. As a boy, Lockwood sang in the choir of his grandfather, Jacob Konigsberg, a renowned cantor who led the High Holidays services at the Loop Synagogue, in Chicago, for several decades. When he was fourteen, Lockwood began a lifelong apprenticeship with the legendary Piedmont blues master guitarist Carolina Slim, which mainly consisted of busking alongside the impeccably dressed Slim in Manhattan subway stations.

        Jeremiah Lockwood's music career began with over a decade of
        apprenticeship to the legendary Piedmont Blues musician Carolina Slim,
        playing in the subways of New York City. He also trained under his
        grandfather Cantor Jacob Konigsberg and performed in his choir.
        Jeremiah's band The Sway Machinery seeks inspiration from diverse realms
        of experience related to the cultural geography of New York City. The
        Sway Machinery has played around the world, including stints at
        legendary music festivals like Montreal Jazz, Roskilde, and perhaps most
        notably, Festival au Desert in Timbuktu, Mali. In addition to leading
        The Sway Machinery, Jeremiah toured for years as guitarist in the
        popular world-beat band Balkan Beat Box and has scored numerous film and
        video projects. Jeremiah was a recipient of the 2007-8 Six Points
        Fellowship for Emerging Jewish Artists, was 2010 Artist-in-Residence for
        the Forward and was a 2011 Brooklyn Philharmonic Orchestra Composer
        Fellow. Jeremiah's duo project with musician Jewlia Eisenberg, Book of
        J, released their debut album in 2018 to critical acclaim. Jeremiah has
        also produced an album of some of the young Chassidic cantors he worked
        with as part of his dissertation research; this album will be released
        in the next year.
