Jeremiah Lockwood and Ricky Gordon have been making music together for over two decades, originally as disciples of Piedmont Blues legend Carolina Slim. For their first post-pandemic live shows they have begun a new duo to share the sonic pleasures stored up over a tumultuous year of longing. Expect old time blues, new-time rhythms, and ballads about all the things we want to do with you.

Singer/guitarist Jeremiah Lockwood is the founder of The Sway Machinery, a world-exploring, genre-defying band perhaps best known for its collaborations with the late great Khaira Arby of Timbuktu.

Drummer Ricky Gordon is a member of the Wynton Marsalis Ensemble and a prolific composer for the screen, including iconic collaborations with Spike Lee.
