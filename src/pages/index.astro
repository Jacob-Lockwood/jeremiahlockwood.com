      <p>
        Jeremiah Lockwood is a scholar and a storyteller; a singer, guitarist
        and composer with an expansive knowledge of musical traditions and
        techniques that range from cantorial sacred music to Piedmont blues. His
        career as musician and academic engages with issues arising from peering
        into the archive and imagining the power of “lost” forms of expression
        to articulate keenly felt needs in the present.

          This special record release event will feature a double header of
          performances of new albums coming out on Khazones Underground. The
          Return of the Immortal Khazntes pays tribute to the pioneering women
          cantors of the early 20th century and features Berkson, Riki Rose,
          Shahanna McKinney-Baldon and Rachel Weston (and special guest!). The
          Dream Past is the first album in a decade from The Sway Machinery;
          this new project from the band takes its inspiration from bootleg
          tapes of cantors recorded secretly during synagogue performance.
          Expect virtuosic vocal performances, radical recontextualizations of
          the sacred, and a joyful noise scavenged from the mouths of ghosts!

            <i>
              Golden Ages: Hasidic Singers and Cantorial Revival in the Digital
              Era
            </i> relates the engaging stories of a group of non-conformist musicians
            in the New York Chassidic community. Cantorial revivalists are singers
            who have immersed themselves in the archive of early 20th century commercial
            Jewish liturgical records, approaching them as a source to build performance
            identities and musical style. The work of cantorial revivalists is a
            product of the digital era, shaped both by access to internet-based archival
            sources and social media platforms for self- promotion. More frequently
            heard online, in private parties and in concert venues than in synagogues,
            the work of cantorial revival pushes at normative associations with Jewish
            prayer, blurring the line between ritual and art.

      Jeremiah Lockwood is a scholar and musician, working in the fields of
      Jewish studies, performance studies and ethnomusicology. His work engages
      with issues arising from peering into the archive and imagining the power
      of “lost” forms of expression to articulate keenly felt needs in the
      present. Both his music performance and scholarship gravitate towards the
      Jewish liturgical music and Yiddish expressive culture of the early 20th
      century and the reverberations of this cultural moment in present day
      artistic and religious communities. Jeremiah’s research considers the work
      of cantors as arbiters of social, intellectual and aesthetic change in
      times of crisis and cultural transformation. Jeremiah is a current
      Visiting Professor in the Borns Jewish Studies Program at Indiana
      University. His first book, <i>
        Golden Ages: Hasidic singers and cantorial revival in the digital era</i
      >, was published by University of California Press in February 2024. He is
      the cofounder, working with Judith Berkson, of Khazones Underground, a new
      record label and cultural organization dedicated to promoting voices of
      cantorial revival. His new piece for cantorial voices and chamber
      orchestra, titled Selichos/Transformation, premiered in September 2025.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jeremiah received his PhD from the Stanford University Graduate School of
      Education Concentration in Education and Jewish Studies in 2021. His
      dissertation and book project illuminates the work of contemporary Hasidic
      cantors who embrace early 20th century cantorial music as a non-conforming
      aesthetic and spiritual practice that cuts against the grain of the
      musical and social norms of their birth community. Jeremiah was a 2023-24
      UPenn Katz Center Fellow, where he conducted research on early 20th
      cantors and worked on developing his second book on gramophone era
      cantorial culture. He was a 2022-23 Yale Institute of Sacred Music Fellow,
      where he conducted research on the <i lang="y">khaznte</i> phenomenon of popular
      women performers of cantorial music in the early 20th century and composed
      a new piece of music, titled <i lang="y">In der vayber shul</i>/In the
      Women’s Synagogue that offered a creative response to this fecund moment
      in Jewish musical history and premiered at Yale on April 1, 2023. Jeremiah
      was the recipient of the 2021 Salo Baron New Voices in Jewish Studies
      Award and the 2019-20 recipient of the YIVO Kremen Memorial Fellowship in
      East European Arts, Music and Theater.

      Lockwood’s music career began with over a decade of apprenticeship to the
      legendary Piedmont Blues musician Carolina Slim, playing in the subways of
      New York City. He also trained under his grandfather Cantor Jacob
      Konigsberg and performed in his choir. His band The Sway Machinery seeks
      inspiration from diverse realms of experience related to the cultural
      geography of New York City. The Sway Machinery has played around the
      world, most recently performing their new cantorial-inspired project
      titled The Dream Past in Krakow in June 2024. In addition to leading The
      Sway Machinery, Lockwood toured for years as guitarist in the popular
      world-beat band Balkan Beat Box and has scored numerous film and video
      projects. Lockwood’s duo project with musician Jewlia Eisenberg (of
      blessed memory), Book of J, released their debut album in 2018 to critical
      acclaim and were artists in residence at YIVO, University of Colorado,
      University of Chicago, Williams College, and Cornell University, among
      other residencies and projects. Since 2022, Lockwood has spearheaded a
      touring project with Hasidic cantors, producing concerts, accompanying
      cantors and arranging music for string quartet. Lockwood has presented the
      “Golden Ages: Brooklyn Hasidic Cantors” concert at the Hamburg
      Elbphilharmonie in 2024, among other prestigious venues.

    <p>
      Lockwood continues to maintain an active performance schedule with The
      Sway Machinery, with Gordon Lockwood, his duo project with percussionist
      Ricky Gordon, a fellow disciple of Carolina Slim, and as a touring member
      of The Ebony Hillbillies, pioneers of African American old-time string
      band music.
