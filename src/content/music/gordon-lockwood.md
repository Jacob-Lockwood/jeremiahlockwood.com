Jeremiah Lockwood and Ricky Gordon have been making music together for over two decades, originally as disciples of Piedmont Blues legend Carolina Slim. For their first post-pandemic live shows they have begun a new duo to share the sonic pleasures stored up over a tumultuous year of longing. Expect old time blues, new-time rhythms, and ballads about all the things we want to do with you.

Singer/guitarist Jeremiah Lockwood is the founder of The Sway Machinery, a world-exploring, genre-defying band perhaps best known for its collaborations with the late great Khaira Arby of Timbuktu.

Drummer Ricky Gordon is a member of the Wynton Marsalis Ensemble and a prolific composer for the screen, including iconic collaborations with Spike Lee.

      In the multimedia album Once Upon a Time the Fire Burned Brighter: Ballads from
      the Yiddish Gothic, scholar and musician Jeremiah Lockwood opens a doorway into
      the rich sensorium of the Yiddish ballad. Drawing deeply from the work of
      legendary Yiddish folk singer Lifshe Schaechter-Widman, the collection
      reimagines and recasts Yiddish ballads through audio and video performances by
      Gordon Lockwood (the musical project of Lockwood and drummer Ricky Gordon),
      which appear beside archival visuals, lyric adaptations, and textual
      explorations. Once Upon a Time the Fire Burned Brighter invites us to experience
      a body of Jewish song that emerges from a world of fantasy, memory, and
      symbol—constituting a Yiddish gothic, a folk expressionism unapologetic in the
      extremes of its enticing imagery.
