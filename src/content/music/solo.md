Jeremiah Lockwood has made several solo albums over the years that showcase his fingerpicking guitar style, his connection to historic genres of blues and Jewish music, and collaborations with important artists.

## RECORDS

### LOCKWOOD (System Dialing Records, 2014)

This record represents the first ever documentation of Jeremiah's performance as a solo Blues guitarist and vocalist. LOCKWOOD represents a loving and visceral presentation of the revered country blues tradition Lockwood learned from his longtime teacher and collaborator, the late great Piedmont Blues legend Carolina Slim. Lockwood and Carolina Slim performed together on the streets and in the subways of New York City for close to two decades.

### Kol Nidre (Because Jewish, 2016)

Kol Nidre contains nothing but enigmas---it is a fairly dry legalistic text that has come to be looked at as soul drenched poetry, ringing tears from the eyes of the people as they contemplate their mortality. The famous Kol Nidre melody is considered one of the oldest in the cantorial music canon, dating to the Middle Ages, and yet it's melody plainly bears the mark of 'modern' European classical music influence, attesting to the endless changes that Jewish sacred music is constantly undergoing. On this record I try to take all of these paradoxes into account, drawing from the arcane and the earthy, the folkloric and the modernist, to make something that holds true to the beautiful shape-shifting of the cantorial music tradition. Features Shoko Nagai on organs and John Bollinger on drums.

### The Nigun Project, (The Forward, 2011)

Brooklyn musician Jeremiah Lockwood, front man for The Sway Machinery, collaborated with diverse partners from a wide variety of musical fields and genres to create 10 original nigunim, or songs (mostly) without words -- meditative and incantatory melodies to raise the spirits, transform the mundane into the holy and elevate the soul toward the divine. Crossing continents and genres, this imaginative collection of recordings is the product of Lockwood's yearlong appointment as artist in residence at The Forward.

### American Primitive (VeeRon Records, 2005)
