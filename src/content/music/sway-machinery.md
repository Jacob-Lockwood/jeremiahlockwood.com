In 2023, long-running New York-based band The Sway Machinery premiered The Dream
Past: A Sonic Conjuring, the latest project of the “unclassifiable and
uplifting” (The New Yorker) Brooklyn rock band, The Sway Machinery. Featuring
the double-front of vocalists Yuli Ya’el Be’eri and band-leader Jeremiah
Lockwood, the ace horn section of band-cofounders Stuart Bogie and Jordan
McLean, and the great beauty of drummer John Bollinger, The Dream Past extends
the band’s long running project of cantorial revival—excavating the otherworldly
potentials of Jewish sacred music and lost melodies to instigate a party, break
boundaries between communities, and touch the past. Like its debut project,
Hidden Melodies Revealed, which also drew upon High Holidays liturgy, The Dream
Past offers an expansive vision of what can be achieved through commitment to
ancestor voices and reciprocity with the dead. This new work turns to a lost and
now rediscovered archive of bootleg recordings of live prayer leading as the
source material for its ecstatic transformation.

Founded around the year 2005, The Sway Machinery’s sound is rooted in the
personal history of bandleader Jeremiah Lockwood, whose education included
singing in the choir of his grandfather, Cantor Jacob Konigsberg and over a
decade of playing in the subways of New York City with Piedmont Blues legend
Carolina Slim. The Sway Machinery has a long history of producing unique concert
events that call upon the social qualities of the Yiddish-spiritual music
tradition known as khazones (cantorial art music). Part rock concert, part
theatrical experience, their shows have presented a unique facet of New York
City culture for decades, drawing together diverse communities in a radically
inclusive environment.

The band’s breakthrough project, Hidden Melodies Revealed, was an event that
blurred the line between ritual and concert, repurposing the Rosh HaShana
(Jewish new year) service as an art experience and immersive spectacle.
Collaborating artists on the project included actress/singer Yuli Ya'el Be’eri,
film maker Shawn Atkins, puppet maker Paul Andrejco and artist Andrea Deszo. The
project debuted in 2007 at the Angel Orensanz Center on the Lower East Side of
Manhattan, on the site of the former Slonimer Synagogue where Lockwood’s
grandfather’s debut concert took place in 1949. In 2009 the band released an
album of music from the project and performed a version of the project in Los
Angeles and San Francisco.

In January of 2010, The Sway Machinery traveled to Mali to perform at the
legendary Festival of the Desert in Timbuktu. While in Mali, the group recorded
its second full-length album, The House of Friendly Ghosts Vol.1. The record
featured collaborations with luminaries of Malian music, including Vieux Farka
Toure and Khaira Arby. The band toured nationally and in Europe in support of
the album, including numerous appearances with Khaira Arby.

In 2012-13 The Sway Machinery continued to burn up dance floors and festival
stages around the world, including debuts in Australia, Israel, Warsaw, Mexico
City and at legendary festivals Montreal Jazz and Roskilde in Denmark. In March
2015, they released their third LP, entitled Purity and Danger, juxtaposing
songs about the subway and dead lovers with 200-year-old Cantorial melodies
performed for the first time in generations. The album was followed by an EP of
original love songs, You Will Love No One But Me.

After a partial hiatus, the band is currently working on releasing a flood of
new music: an album of The Dream Past recently recorded during marathon sessions
in Krakow, Poland, and a beautiful and strikingly different album titled
Memories of Old New York produced by Stuart Bogie and featuring arrangements by
Bogie, Lockwood and Yuli Ya'el Be'eri, a long time collaborator of the band who
has joined the group in recent, reinvigorating the music and live show. Look out
for new releases and record release shows in 2025!!!
