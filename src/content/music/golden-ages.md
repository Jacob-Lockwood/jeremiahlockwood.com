title: Golden Ages
image: /images/golden_ages.jpeg
previewText: Produced by Dr. Jeremiah Lockwood, Golden Ages is a window into a remarkable music scene in today's Brooklyn that is bubbling with life, hidden away from view of most music lovers. It is located in communities in Williamsburg and Borough Park, and its key players are young Chassidic singers. In the ultra-Orthodox community, older forms of Jewish music have largely been displaced by pop-music that sounds a lot like what you would hear on the mainstream radio, but with pious lyrics in Yiddish or prayer book Hebrew. A small but vibrant group of young singers have taken up the style of pre-World War Two cantorial music as their art form of choice, performing tracks recorded a century ago. This album documents the raw and vital sounds of communication across the divide of time.
