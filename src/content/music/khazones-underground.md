Once upon a time there was a certain kind of person in the world—a Jewish sacred
artist called a _khazn_ (cantor) whose music was beloved in the international
Yiddish-speaking Jewish world. _Khazones_ is the Yiddish term for the work of
the khazn—the spiritual sound that represented the community through a deeply
desired musical expression that mirrored the soul of the collective. While the
era of khazones is often spoken of in the past tense, rumors of its death may
not be so true…

Two of the brightest voices in new Jewish music, Jeremiah Lockwood and Judith
Berkson, have joined forces to start a new record label and cultural
organization, **_Khazones Underground_**. Our recorded music series will feature
work by the best and brightest of contemporary artists delving into the archive
of Jewish spiritual music to speak to deeply felt needs of the present day.
These new cantorial voices stun with a profound emotionalism, rigorous
virtuosity and modal richness, and with the potential for trans-historic
communication with the ancestors through revival and recontextualization.
Khazones, with its old-world intonations and soloistic performance approach, has
been rejected by the institutions of contemporary Jewish America—but its music
has an indelible hold on creative artists.

**It is now time for the cantor’s voice to return**. Artists from around the
world are finding khazones and rediscovering meaning, spirituality and
expression in this rich historic rich art form. This artist-driven vision of
spirituality, memory and heritage is more relevant and needed than ever.

We invite you to
[**participate in the cantorial revival**](https://fundraising.fracturedatlas.org/khazones-underground/campaigns/7069).
We propose that khazones holds a place in the world of today, and that music
lovers like you have an active role to play, alongside artists, as cultural
activists. Your contributions will make it possible for the archive of Jewish
sacred sound to speak again. Your tax deductible donations (of any amount!) will
help bring this project into the light. Supporters will receive the albums on
digital and vinyl platforms, as well as access to other unique offerings.

Through our recording projects, Lockwood and Berkson present the work of artists
engaged in culture making projects that will reverberate in the present and into
the future. Drawing on decades of experience in music production, archival
research, and composition, we bring unique and radical perspectives on the
cantorial tradition to the forefront, promoting new communities, devoted to
creativity, celebration of outsider voices, and heritage reclamation.

**_Khazones Underground: Voices from the Cantorial Revival - Initial
Offerings_**

In December 2025, _Khazones Underground_ will begin its mission of releasing new
albums of cantorial revialist artists. Our first releases will be:

**Golden Ages: Brooklyn Hasidic Cantorial Revival Today** _This record is a
reissue of the 2022 release that has been out of print for over two years!_

In today’s Brooklyn, there is a remarkable music revival bubbling with life,
hidden away from view of most music fans. It is located in communities in
Williamsburg and Borough Park, and its key players are young Hasidic singers. In
the ultra-Orthodox community, older forms of Jewish music have largely been
displaced by pop-music that sounds a lot like what you would hear on the
mainstream radio, but with pious lyrics in Yiddish or prayer book Hebrew. A
small but vibrant group of young singers have taken up the style of pre-World
War Two cantorial music as their art form of choice, performing tracks recorded
almost a century ago. Featuring stars of the Hasidic cantorial scene including
Yanky Lemmer, Shimmy Miller and Yoel Kohn, Golden Ages documents the raw and
vital sounds of communication across the divide of time. In a community that
places many limits on self-expression, Hasidic cantorial revivalists have found
creative voices by delving into the past. This recording project, produced by
Jeremiah Lockwood at Brooklyn’s home of soul, Daptone Studios, is a celebration
of new life paths and new sounds culled from the hidden sonic world of classic
cantorial records. After a release in 2022 and subsequently going out of print,
this impactful album documenting a key movement in contemporary Jewish music is
finally available again.

**The Return of the Immortal _Khazntes_**

_Khaznte_ is the Yiddish language term that was used in the early 20th century
to describe Jewish women who sang khazones. The Return of the Immortal
_Khazntes_ documents the work of new Jewish women’s voices who turn to the
cantorial gramophone era to help build their own creative practice. This album
features four artists working on personal projects of heritage reclamation:
Judith Berkson, an unclassifiable singer, cantor, composer and scholar whose
work tears down many barriers between worlds of sound, accompanied on this
record by new music icons Kronos Quartet; Shahanna McKinney-Baldon, a musician
and activist who is currently working on a research and performance project
dedicated to the groundbreaking career of Madame Goldie Steiner, the only known
African American woman performer of khazones in the cantorial golden age period;
internet celebrity Riki Rose, a singer who has moved beyond her Satmar Hasidic
community to frame a liberatory career as an artist and creative persona; and
Rachel Weston, a British cantor and Yiddishist who applies her deep knowledge of
Yiddish vocal music to her approach to _khazones_, accompanied by rising stars
in the traditional music world Fran & Flora.

**The Sway Machinery: The Dream Past**

The Dream Past is the latest project of the “unclassifiable and uplifting” (The
New Yorker) Brooklyn rock band, The Sway Machinery; it is the band’s first
record to be released in a decade. The Dream Past extends the band’s long
running project of cantorial revival—excavating the otherworldly potentials of
Jewish sacred music and lost melodies to instigate a party, break boundaries
between communities, and touch the past. Like its debut album, _Hidden Melodies
Revealed_, which also drew upon High Holidays liturgy, The Dream Past offers an
expansive vision of what can be achieved through commitment to ancestor voices
and reciprocity with the dead. This new work turns to a lost and now
rediscovered archive of bootleg recordings of live prayer leading as the source
material for its ecstatic transformation.

**What is cantorial revival?**

Khazones on record was a pop music phenomenon in the early decades of the 20th
century. The style of great cantorial voices captured an imagined folklore,
preserving sounds of the rapidly disappearing Eastern European Jewish world. The
creative genius and virtuosity of the stars of the genre were passionately
desired by a mass audience and understood as an integral part of the experience
of Jewish life. New rabbinically-unregulated media outlets created opportunities
for women to work as _khazntes_ (women performers of khazones), transcending
boundaries that had alienated women from public leadership roles in synagogue
ritual. Khazns and khazntes were artists who straddled worlds: their voices
transcribed the pain and the fantasies of transcendence long associated with
Jewish prayer. At the same time, they were modern artists absorbed in the
political and social transformations of the day and sought to channel these
themes into their music of prayer. This model of Jewish creative sacred
performer has largely faded from memory.

Drawing on the recorded music legacy of the “golden age” of cantorial music, a
cohort of artists today are reanimating the sonic archive of star cantors of the
phonograph era as the substance of a musical revival. Driven by the pursuit of
formal achievement, radical recontextualization that addresses the needs of the
current moment, and spiritual commitment, cantorial revivalists are drawn from a
variety of identities at the fringes of American Jewish life, including Hasidic
intellectuals, avant garde composers, leftist political activists, and secular
Yiddishists.

**Jeremiah Lockwood** is a scholar, singer, guitarist and composer. His musical
career began with years of playing guitar with blues musician Carolina Slim, and
in synagogue singing with his grandfather Cantor Jacob Konigsberg. Lockwood is
founder and frontman of The Sway Machinery, a group whose music the New Yorker
has described as “unclassifiable and uplifting.” He holds a PhD from Stanford
University in Education and Jewish Studies, where his dissertation fieldwork
focused on young Hasidic cantors in Brooklyn, and is a 2025-26 fellow at the
Frankel Center for Advanced Judaic Studies at University of Michigan. Lockwood
has recorded 14 albums as leader, toured internationally, and been the recipient
of numerous academic honors including the Salo Baron New Voices in Jewish
Studies Award and the YIVO Kremen Memorial Fellowship in East European Arts,
Music and Theater.

**Judith Berkson** is a mezzo-soprano, pianist, accordionist, and composer. She
is a second-generation cantor who grew up performing liturgical music with her
father and family. She studied classical voice at New England Conservatory with
additional studies in jazz, klezmer, and Yiddish song with Hankus Netsky. She
received her master’s in composition from Wesleyan University and a doctorate
from California Institute of the Arts. Along with her work as a cantor, she has
an international career as a composer and performer and has presented her music
at Picasso Museum, Malaga, Amsterdam’s Concertgebouw, BrucknerTage, Carnegie
Hall, and at Lincoln Center. Her opera The Vienna Rite, about 19th century
Viennese chief cantor Salomon Sulzer and his collaboration with composer Franz
Schubert, was performed by the ensemble Yarn/Wire and presented by Roulette, Six
Points Fellowship, and the New York Foundation for the Arts. Judith has also
sung Schubert and new commissions with Kronos Quartet and has arranged classic
recordings of khazones for the quartet. Her interest in cantorial music is
focused on “golden-age” gramophone era recordings of cantors, working to revive
this art of chant and improvisation with roots in pre-Holocaust Europe. She also
calls attention to the khazntes, female cantorial singers who recorded and
performed during this period despite being restricted from traditional synagogue
leadership. Judith was a fellow at the YIVO Institute where she revived pieces
from their archives and wrote a new work based on their collection which
featured Frank London and Cleek Schrey. Judith has served as a synagogue cantor
for over twenty years including in Quincy, MA, Kane Street Synagogue in
Brooklyn, NY, and Plainview Jewish Center in Plainview, NY. She is currently the
cantor at Congregation Beth Shalom in Santa Clarita, CA.
