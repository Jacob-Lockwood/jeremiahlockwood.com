The term cantorial “golden age” signals a period of mediatization and
popularization of Ashkenazi liturgical music in the transnational
Yiddish-speaking Jewish community from roughly the last decade of the
19<sup>th</sup> century to the decade following the Holocaust. In this period
cantors moved ritual music out of synagogue spaces and into the newly emerging
media sphere of concert stages, Yiddish theater, radio and, most crucially for
the emergence of new practices of sacred listening, the gramophone record.
Cantors of the golden age offered a model of a new form of Jewish personhood: an
artist who moved between worlds of aesthetic achievement, performance, sensual
pop culture iconography, engagement with the burning political ideologies of the
period, and sacred authority.

My proposed second book project I am currently at work on, <cite>Melody Like a
Confession</cite>, will constitute the first monograph on the cultural history
of the transnational gramophone era cantorial phenomenon. This proposed book
project will bridge archival research, ethnomusicological analysis, and a
cultural studies approach steeped in the fields of performance studies and
comparative literature. The project is premised on the view of cantorial music
as both a form of expressive culture and an intellectual movement within a
rapidly evolving period of social change and cultural reinvention. Cantorial
music, in the eyes of its key practitioners and their critics on both sides of
the Jewish Atlantic world, offered a populist response to modernization, state
violence, and migration.

In my previous dissertation research and book project, titled <cite>Golden Ages:
Hasidic singers and cantorial revival in the digital era</cite>, I offered an
ethnographic study of young singers in the Brooklyn Hasidic community who look
to the cantorial golden age for the stylistic basis of their own aesthetic
explorations. In my book I propose a view of their work as a non-conforming
social practice within the conservative contemporary Hasidic community. Hasidic
cantors call upon the sounds and structures of Jewish sacred musical heritage to
stage a disruption in the aesthetics and power hierarchies of their community.
Beyond its role as a desirable art form, golden age cantorial music offers a
model for aspiring Hasidic singers of a form of Jewish cultural productivity in
which artistic excellence, maverick outsider status, and sacred authority were
aligned. The work of these contemporary cantors offers clues about the meaning
of the work of gramophone era cantors, suggesting that these historical figures
offer a precedent for musical and social practices that defy institutional
authority and push at normative boundaries of sacred and secular by
foregrounding artist’s voices in the culturally intimate space of prayer.

I intend for my further research on “golden age” cantors to amend a lacuna in
modern Jewish cultural history and contribute to broader interventions that
advocate for a view of artists and aesthetics as needed elements in constructing
histories of marginalized communities. Pursuing archival research about
gramophone era cantors, I have made preliminary findings in the Yiddish press
that suggest cantors were founts of passionate controversy, aesthetic
partisanship, and fulcrums of communal fundraising and organizing in the
immigrant community in the United States. Cantors and their critics debated the
appropriateness of sound recording, performance outside of the synagogue, and
the commercialization of the sacred. These themes in the cantorial sphere
paralleled discussions among Yiddish authors about the dialectical role of
literature and theater as forms of intellectual cultivation versus their
potential impact as a degrading form of populism. Cantors engaged in cultivating
a conception of Jewish memory that pivoted between nostalgic images of an
imagined Jewish folkloric past and appeals to the ineffable and transcendent in
music that would establish a Jewish aesthetic parallel to the achievements of
European classical music. These aesthetic claims run parallel to contemporary
Jewish political movements that pivoted between nationalism and socialism.

Artists in the cantorial market were often considered “outsiders” because of
their lack of rabbinic pedigree or economic elite status. Cantorial stars were
at times reviled by conservative critics for their lack of adherence to norms of
religious orthodoxy, even as they were subjects of public adulation. The
emergence of new media opened cantorial performance to artists with
controversial identities, including women cantors, often referred to in Yiddish
as <i lang="y">khazentes</i>. The <i lang="y">khazente</i> phenomenon, that
seems to have begun in the 1910s, brought women cantors to the forefront of
popularity, even as they were rejected as ritual leaders in synagogues. The
study of the cantorial golden age will bring these important yet forgotten
artists into the light of day and reevaluate the gendered history of liturgy and
aesthetics by attending to their work.

<cite>Melody Like a Confession</cite> will address the central themes of the
cantorial populist movement in thematically organized chapters. I have already
completed a draft of a chapter on the <i lang="y">khazentes</i>, early
20<sup>th</sup> century women cantors. I have developed a prospectus and
research agenda for the other chapters of the book. The proposed chapter are: an
introduction that will offer a synthetic approach to the representation of
cantors and their music in the Yiddish press and literature; a chapter focusing
on the political commitments of cantors and their pivotal involvement as
ideologues and fund raisers in labor union politics and Zionism; a chapter that
will focus on the culture of chastisement and the ethical ambiguities that
surrounded cantors as both preservers of sacred heritage and pop culture stars;
and a final chapter that will look at the reception of the cantorial gramophone
era in its various “afterlives” across the 20 th and 21 st centuries. This work
will present an important reparative to the dearth of serious scholarship on an
era that is referred to as a “golden age” and that plays an outsized and highly
mythologized role in the conception of Jewish musical heritage. By placing
cantors in dialogue with Yiddish literature and Jewish political movements, I
will move the discussion of Jewish sacred music out of its current highly
parochialized place and cultivate a more robust approach to this pivotal
intellectual and aesthetic movement in Jewish life.
