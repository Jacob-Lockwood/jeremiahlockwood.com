<i lang="y">Golden Ages: Hasidic Singers and Cantorial Revival in the Digital
Era</i> relates the engaging stories of a group of non-conformist musicians in
the New York Chassidic community. Cantorial revivalists are singers who have
immersed themselves in the archive of early 20th century commercial Jewish
liturgical records, approaching them as a source to build performance identities
and musical style. The work of cantorial revivalists is a product of the digital
era, shaped both by access to internet-based archival sources and social media
platforms for self- promotion. More frequently heard online, in private parties
and in concert venues than in synagogues, the work of cantorial revival pushes
at normative associations with Jewish prayer, blurring the line between ritual
and art.

I suggest that contemporary Hasidic cantorial revivalists are not only reviving
a style of music but are also engaged in a revival of a form of comportment in
prayer that foregrounds the role of cantor as arbiter of sacred experience. For
cantorial revivalists to achieve their musical goals they must interpolate
audiences into an embodied emotional response to the musical cues of the prayer
leader. Producing this kind of sacred music community, centered on the
experience of listening to the archive, is a utopian aspiration that has not
been realized by the revivalists, and perhaps cannot be achieved in the cultural
climate of the American synagogue. This has not dissuaded singers from investing
time and resources into self-cultivation of a musical practice with no clear
home in the current moment.

Golden Ages: Brooklyn Chassidic Cantorial Revival Today, an album produced by
Jeremiah Lockwood featuring some of the brightest voices in the Brooklyn
cantorial scene, will be reissued in 2024.

Concerts of cantors featured in the book take place on an ongoing basis.

Look out for a Germany tour in March 2024! A concert with Yanky Lemmer, Yoel
Kohn and Shimmy Miller, produced, accompanied and featuring new string quartet
arrangements by Lockwood, debuted at the 2022 Krakow Jewish Culture Festival.
