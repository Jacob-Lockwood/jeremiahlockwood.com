Forthcoming article in <cite>Jewish Social Studies</cite>. At the onset of the
21<sup>st</sup> century, Jewish musicians from across a diverse array of
communities have displayed a renewed interest in <i lang="y">khazones</i>, an
aestheticized version of cantorial prayer leading associated with a mass
mediated pop culture phenomenon in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. This
musical revival of a century old genre of prayer music has been facilitated in
part due to a new accessibility of recordings of cantorial prayer performance
through the internet. Surreptitiously collected field recordings of cantors at
the pulpit, made in disregard for the rules of synagogue comportment, circulated
for decades among a small group of collectors in an underground economy of
homemade dubbed cassettes. These secret recordings, referred to as “live
davenings,” usurp the characteristic ephemerality of prayer to document a
20<sup>th</sup> century aesthetic concept of cantorial music as an art form
beyond its ritual function. In the past decade many of these recordings have
surfaced on YouTube and file sharing sites, reaching an expanded audience,
exposing a new generation to a largely abandoned style of liturgical
performance. Through ethnography with elder field recording makers,
internet-savvy collectors, and the artists who use the secrets in the live
davening archive to build projects of cantorial revival, this article offers an
examination of a body of archival material that has not previously been the
topic of any scholarly investigation. This exploration of live davenings
contributes to a fuller historical picture of the role media plays in
determining what constitutes a reliable source of knowledge about Jewish sacred
sound in America, arguing that electronically mediated prayer music serves as a
form of prosthesis that repairs lost cultural intimacy, protecting against the
perceived deterioration of tradition, a crisis that haunts both the cantorial
profession and broader discourses within Jewish American culture.
