            After two years of quiet and introspection, The Sway
            Machinery is back. Reunited and with the invigoration of
            our old friend Yula Be'eri on bass and vocals, we are
            partying our way towards the future we dreamed of
            together. If you rue the fact you missed our last program,
            there's no need to mourn; we'll be out there again
            soon...you can get on our
            <a href="http://eepurl.com/goSc9D">mailing list here.</a>
            Thank you friends!

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            &quot;This unclassifiable, uplifting band is led by the
            singer and guitarist Jeremiah Lockwood, the grandson of
            the renowned cantor Jacob Konigsberg, whose choir Lockwood
            once sang in. Lockwood's diverse musical influences also
            include a nearly two-decade apprenticeship in the New York
            subways with the legendary Piedmont blues master Carolina
            Slim and a collaboration with several prominent Malian
            musicians which took place on a long visit there a few
            years ago.&quot; --The New Yorker

          The Sway Machinery's sound is rooted in the personal history
          of bandleader Jeremiah Lockwood, whose storied education
          included singing in the choir of his grandfather, Cantor
          Jacob Konigsberg and over a decade of playing in the subways
          of New York City with Piedmont Blues legend Carolina Slim.
          Lockwood's musical vision of worlds colliding in the
          experience of the individual has been aided and abetted by a
          stellar cast of band mates. The collective of brilliant
          musicians that make up the band features drummer John
          Bollinger, of Barbez, members of NYC afrobeat pioneers
          Antibalas, including band co-founder trumpeter Jordan
          McLean, bass player Nikhil Yerawadekar and guitarist Timothy
          Allen, and Arcade Fire sideman Matt Bauder on tenor
          saxophone. Past members of the collective have included bass
          saxophonist Colin Stetson (Arcade Fire), drummer Brian Chase
          (Yeah Yeah Yeahs), Israeli percussionist Tomer Tzur and
          saxophonist Stuart Bogie (TV on the Radio, Iron and Wine).

          The band's breakthrough project, Hidden Melodies Revealed,
          was an event that blurred the line between ritual and
          concert, repurposing the Rosh HaShana (Jewish new year)
          service as an art experience and immersive spectacle.
          Collaborating artists on the project included actress/singer
          Yula Be'eri, film maker Shawn Atkins, puppet maker Paul
          Andrejco and artist Andrea Deszo. The project debuted in
          2007 at the Angel Orensanz Center on the Lower East Side of
          Manhattan, on the site of the former Slonimer Synagogue
          where Lockwood's grandfather's debut concert took place in
          1949. In 2009 the band released an album of music from the
          project and performed a version of the project in Los
          Angeles and San Francisco.

          In January of 2010, The Sway Machinery traveled to Mali to
          perform at the legendary Festival of the Desert in Timbuktu.
          While in Mali, the group recorded its second full-length
          album, The House of Friendly Ghosts Vol.1. The record
          featured collaborations with luminaries of Malian music,
          including Vieux Farka Toure and Khaira Arby. The band toured
          nationally and in Europe in support of the album, including
          numerous appearances with Khaira Arby.

          In 2012-13 The Sway Machinery continued to burn up dance
          floors and festival stages around the world, including
          debuts in Australia, Israel, Warsaw, Mexico City and at
          legendary festivals Montreal Jazz and Roskilde in Denmark.

          In March 2015, released their third LP, entitled Purity and
          Danger, juxtaposing songs about the subway and dead lovers
          with 200-year-old Cantorial melodies performed for the first
          time in generations. The album was followed by an EP of
          original love songs, You Will Love No One But Me. The band
          is currently working on a new album, inspired by the sounds
          of 20th century New York City, moving from the streets to
          the domestic space of songs sung around the table. This
          latest project is a collaboration with singer, composer and
          actress Yula Be'eri.
